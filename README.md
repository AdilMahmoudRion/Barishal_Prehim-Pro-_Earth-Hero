DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Problem:



One day Sharif and his grandfather were walking at noon beside the river. Sharif asks his grandfather why we became so poor whereas in the old picture I had seen we were rich. His grandfather replied they lost much land because of the delta river’s erosion.



Like sharif, many people lost their lands, lives, and much more. For this kind of erosion, 




Landslides are happening. 


According to scientists 1.2 billion people are living in near the delta rivers. Their life is in danger.


Farmers lose their crops and harvest. A lot of financial loss is happening every year.


According to NASA earth science, Biodiverse ecosystems are breaking.


Even Many people also lost their lives and Home in every year.


NASA also found this problem and raised a question named “TAKE FLIGHT: MAKING THE MOST OF NASA’S AIRBORNE DATA”. NASA wanted people to work on this problem. So, this time we think we are capable to solve this problem.







Our Solution: 



We are solving this problem in various ways. NASA has been collecting airborne data for many years and Delta-X is one of the missions we choose to use for solving the problems. Delta-X's mission happened in the Mississippi River Delta-X and measured water, vegetation, and sediment (soil), sea level.

According to scientists Water level rise, vegetation area less, sea level rises and area loss is affecting major impact on the community and earth science such as landslides, death, biodiversity breaks, Financial losses in agriculture, etc.

So, first of all, we visualize the NASA data from the delta-X mission using GIS, and ML in an interactive way.

On our website, we can see we visualized first of all Louisiana states Landslides area. Then we visualize water level data, water velocity data, biomass, and land loss. This interactive visualization will help every kind of person understand what is happening throughout the area to raise awareness.

In every visualization, we used sound effects for blind people and unable person also. 







Using this data we also predict the future population rate in the affected area, sea level rise as well as land loss and land gain in the affected area. This forecast will aware people of the condition and about their duty. 






According to the Nasa River delta mission, we solve another delta River risk factor and visualize the data and the river is the Ganga-Brahmaputra river delta. Then using machine learning algorithm called SVM is used to forecasting the risk factor in the Ganga-Brahmaputra river delta region.

l also develop a 2D game called earth hero using pygame which will aware and guide people on what to do and what not to do to resume themselves from this problem.

Our Technical Solution:



We used python libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib and seaboarn to process the data. Then we use QGIS to visualize and interact with the visualization. Then we used tensorflow.js,jsontohtml , beautifulsoup to visualize the NASA data into the web and mobile application. We use machine learning algorithms such as SVM, MLR and the fusion techniques of using a voting classifier to find the best accuracy of forecasting. We used pygame also to develop the 2D game to raise awareness.  





Final Outcome:





Policymakers can make decisions by seeing this interactive visualization easily.
Any kind of people can understand the visualization as well as blind and unable people also.
Machine learning and AI-based forecasting will raise awareness in the midst of the people.
2D games also educate people on what to do and what not to do for saving the earth from this situation. 
Forecasting can save the loss of death, and financial losses and can save Bioversity. 




Future objectives:



We will keep our application updated and we will try to add this kind of forecasting for every delta river in the world. Also, we will use modern technology such as 3d modeling, etc. 



SPACE AGENCY DATA
We are using NASA’s Airborne Delta-X missions water level, vegetation, biomass, sediment and land loss.

We also used Google Earth, ISRO, and the Bangladesh government to visualize Ganga -Brahmaputra delta river.
